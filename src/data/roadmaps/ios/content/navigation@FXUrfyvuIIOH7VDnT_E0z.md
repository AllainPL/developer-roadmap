# Navigation

UIKit Navigation refers to the mechanisms for moving between different screens or content areas within an iOS app. The primary tool for this is UINavigationController, which manages a stack of view controllers, enabling hierarchical navigation with a navigation bar for back functionality. UITabBarController facilitates switching between different sections of an app using a tab bar. Modal presentations allow for temporary overlay of content. Custom transitions can be implemented for unique navigation experiences. Effective navigation design is crucial for creating intuitive app structures, ensuring users can easily move through content and understand their current location within the app.
