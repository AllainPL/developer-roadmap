# Storyboards

UIKit Storyboards are visual tools in Xcode for designing and organizing an app's user interface and navigation flow. They allow developers to create and connect multiple view controllers graphically, defining segues for transitions between scenes. Storyboards simplify the process of laying out UI elements, setting up constraints for adaptive layouts, and configuring view controller properties. They support reusable components through custom views and view controllers. While offering benefits like visual representation of app flow and reduced code complexity, storyboards can present challenges in version control and team collaboration.
